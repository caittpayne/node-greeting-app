> What is a Node module?

A Node module is a set of functions you want to include in your application, much like a library.

> What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

The main difference between 'exports' and 'module.exports' is that 'module.exports' is an empty object that's returned by require().
Alternatively, 'exports' is just a reference, or alias, to 'module.exports'.

> Why is using exports recommended?

Using 'exports' is recommended because it is a reference to 'module.exports', and cannot reassign 'module.exports'. This prevents
other functions within that module being rendered unusable.
